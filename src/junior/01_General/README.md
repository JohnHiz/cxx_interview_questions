## 1. General principles of OOP

**Object-oriented programming *(OOP)*** is a programming [*paradigm**](#Footnotes) based on concept of [*objects**](#Footnotes),
which can contain data and code. The *data* is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),
and the *code* is in the form of prodecures (often known as methods).

Many of the most widely used programming languages are multi-paradigm and they support Object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree,
typically in combination with *imperative* and *procedural programming*.

**Main principles:**
1. **Encapsulation.** This is principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select (public) information is exposed.
    The implementation and state of each object are privetly help inside a defined class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the
    authority to make changes. The are only able to call a list of public functions or methods.
2. **Abstraction.** Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code.
    The derived class can have its functionality extended.
3. **Inheritance.** Classes can reuse code from other classes. Relationships and subclasses between object can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse
    common login while still maintaining a unique hierarchy.
4. **Polumorphism.** Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form. The program will detemine which meaning or usage is
    necessary for each execution of that object form a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created, which extends the
    functionality of the parent class. Polumorphism allows different types of objects to pass throught the same interface.

## Footnotes

1. **General principles of OOP:**
    * ***Programming paradigm*** are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.
    * ***Objects*** can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method. As regions of memory, they contain value and are referenced by identifiers.
